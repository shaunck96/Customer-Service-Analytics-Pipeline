## Usage
To use CSPANLP in your project, follow these steps:

### Initialization:
Import the necessary classes from the package and initialize them with appropriate configurations.
```python
from cs_utils_with_pii_redaction import AudioProcessor, AllContextWindowSummaryGenerator, TopicGenerator, sentiment_eval
from db_utils import DBUtilConnectionCreator

# Initialize components with database and storage configurations
db = DBUtilConnectionCreator(dbutils=dbutils)
abfsClient = db.get_abfs_client()
audio_processor = AudioProcessor(abfsClient, pytest_flag=False, db=db)
```

### Audio Transcription and Redaction:
Transcribe audio files and redact sensitive information.
```python
audio_processor.transcription_redaction_trigger()
```

### Summarization:
Generate summaries for transcribed calls.
```python
summary_generator = AllContextWindowSummaryGenerator(db=db, abfs_client=abfsClient, pytest_flag=False)
summary_generator.summary_generation_trigger()
```

### Topic Modeling:
Extract topics from the call summaries.
```python
topic_generator = TopicGenerator(db=db, abfs_client=abfsClient, pytest_flag=False)
topic_generator.topic_generator()
```

### Sentiment Analysis:
Analyze the sentiment of the calls.
```python
sentiment_analyzer = sentiment_eval(db=db, abfs_client=abfsClient, pytest_flag=False)
sentiment_analyzer.sentiment_emotion_classifier()
